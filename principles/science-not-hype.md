# Science. Not Hype.

“Science. Not Hype.” is a principle, not a slogan.

ION BLUE avoids exaggerated language, trend-driven formulation,
and claims that exceed available evidence.

We prioritize:
- Ingredient transparency
- Mechanism-level understanding
- Conservative interpretation of research
- Long-term skin compatibility

Education builds trust.
Clarity compounds credibility.

This principle governs formulation decisions, communication,
and how ION BLUE engages with the skincare industry.
