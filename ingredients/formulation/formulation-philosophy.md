# Formulation Philosophy

ION BLUE follows a minimalist formulation philosophy.

In skincare formulation, more ingredients increase variables.
More variables reduce signal clarity and increase the likelihood
of interference between components.

Our approach prioritizes:
- Signal integrity
- Ingredient compatibility
- Chemical restraint

Each ingredient is included for a specific purpose.
Nothing is added for trend alignment, marketing appeal,
or label decoration.

This philosophy favors precision over complexity and
formulation discipline over excess.
