# Why 0.10% Copper Tripeptide-1

ION BLUE formulates Copper Tripeptide-1 (GHK-Cu) at a concentration of 0.10%
by design, not by marketing convention.

Peptide activity is not linear.
Higher concentrations do not inherently produce better outcomes and may
increase instability, irritation risk, or formulation interference.

Our concentration choice reflects:
- Peptide stability considerations
- Skin tolerance
- Signal clarity over saturation
- Respect for existing research ranges

This approach favors consistency and restraint over escalation.

0.10% is not positioned as “maximum.”
It is positioned as intentional.
